
Benefits of Java


1. Java is Object Oriented
Would you believe me if I told you that a 1300 line functional programming code was reduced to 
just 200 line oop code?? And also the response time got 20 times faster?? 
I learnt the importance of oops the hard way. And you should too.


2. Encapsulation : Java supports access modifiers to protect data from unintended access and modification.


3. Platform Independent : Java is an interpreted language because it gets compiled to
bytecode. A key benefit is that Java code gets compiled once rather than needing to be
recompiled for different operating systems. This is known as “write once, run everywhere”.
i.e. class files run everywhere.


4. Robust: One of the major advantages of Java over C++ is that it prevents memory leaks. 
The Garbage collection.


5. Simple : Java was intended to be simpler than C++. In addition to eliminating pointers,
it got rid of operator overloading. In C++, you could write a + b and have it mean almost
anything.


6. Secure: Java code runs inside the JVM. This creates a sandbox that makes it hard for Java
code to do evil things to the computer it is running on.
